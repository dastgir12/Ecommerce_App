//here we define just great logics which we can apply future i  our code :

// if we want to make a statement as bolean form but statement return integre type form then we have to change it into boolean
// here 0 , 1 represent false and true respectively 


//logic:

//we use !! to convert integer into boolean .

// wrap statement into bracket and then make it .length

// const alreadySaved = !!(save?.filter((item)=>item.postedBy._id === user.sub)).length;
//
